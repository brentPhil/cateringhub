- Cards stack on small screens
- Grid layouts adapt to screen size
- Charts remain readable on all devices

### 4. Consistent Spacing
- `space-y-6` for vertical spacing between sections
- `gap-4` for grid gaps
- `pb-3` for list item padding

### 5. Color Scheme
- Uses CSS variables for theming
- Chart colors: `--chart-1`, `--chart-2`, `--chart-3`, etc.
- Muted colors for secondary information
- Primary colors for key metrics
