# Audit Trigger Coverage Verification

**Migration:** 20251101000011_verify_audit_trigger_coverage.md  
**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Task:** Phase 2 - RLS Policies & Security - Update audit triggers  
**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED - NO CHANGES NEEDED

---

## Executive Summary

**DECISION: No changes needed to audit triggers.**

The existing `audit_booking_changes()` trigger function automatically captures all changes to the bookings table, including the new `service_location_id` and `team_id` fields added in Phase 1.

---

## Current Audit Implementation

### Trigger Function: `audit_booking_changes()`

**Location:** `supabase/migrations/20251028000006_create_booking_audits.sql`

**How it works:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.audit_booking_changes()
RETURNS TRIGGER
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = 'public'
AS $$
DECLARE
  v_action TEXT;
  v_payload JSONB;
BEGIN
  -- Determine action
  IF TG_OP = 'INSERT' THEN
    v_action := 'insert';
    v_payload := to_jsonb(NEW);  -- ✅ Captures ALL columns
  ELSIF TG_OP = 'UPDATE' THEN
    v_action := 'update';
    v_payload := jsonb_build_object(
      'old', to_jsonb(OLD),  -- ✅ Captures ALL old columns
      'new', to_jsonb(NEW)   -- ✅ Captures ALL new columns
    );
  ELSIF TG_OP = 'DELETE' THEN
    v_action := 'delete';
    v_payload := to_jsonb(OLD);  -- ✅ Captures ALL columns
  END IF;

  -- Mask PII in payload
  v_payload := public.mask_pii_in_payload(v_payload);

  -- Insert audit record
  INSERT INTO public.booking_audits (
    booking_id,
    action,
    actor_id,
    payload
  ) VALUES (
    COALESCE(NEW.id, OLD.id),
    v_action,
    auth.uid(),
    v_payload
  );

  RETURN COALESCE(NEW, OLD);
END;
$$;
```

---

## Why No Changes Are Needed

### 1. Automatic Column Capture ✅

The trigger uses `to_jsonb(NEW)` and `to_jsonb(OLD)`, which automatically converts the entire row to JSON, including:
- ✅ All existing columns
- ✅ Newly added columns (`service_location_id`, `team_id`)
- ✅ Future columns added to the bookings table

**This means the audit trail automatically includes:**
- `service_location_id` changes
- `team_id` changes
- All other booking field changes

### 2. PII Masking ✅

The `mask_pii_in_payload()` function only masks specific PII fields:
- `customer_name`
- `customer_phone`
- `customer_email`

**It does NOT mask:**
- `service_location_id` (UUID, not PII)
- `team_id` (UUID, not PII)
- `assigned_to` (UUID, not PII)
- Other operational fields

This is correct behavior - we want to audit team assignments.

### 3. Trigger Scope ✅

The trigger is attached to the bookings table:
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_audit_booking_changes
  AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON public.bookings
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION public.audit_booking_changes();
```

This means:
- ✅ All INSERT operations are audited
- ✅ All UPDATE operations are audited (including team assignments)
- ✅ All DELETE operations are audited

## Verification Examples

### Example 1: Booking Created with Team Assignment

**Operation:**
```sql
INSERT INTO bookings (
  provider_id,
  customer_id,
  service_location_id,
  team_id,
  event_date,
  status
) VALUES (
  'provider-uuid',
  'customer-uuid',
  'location-uuid',
  'team-uuid',
  '2025-11-15',
  'pending'
);
```

**Audit Record Created:**
```json
{
  "booking_id": "booking-uuid",
  "action": "insert",
  "actor_id": "user-uuid",
  "payload": {
    "id": "booking-uuid",
    "provider_id": "provider-uuid",
    "customer_id": "customer-uuid",
    "service_location_id": "location-uuid",  // ✅ Captured
    "team_id": "team-uuid",                   // ✅ Captured
    "event_date": "2025-11-15",
    "status": "pending",
    "customer_name": "***REDACTED***",
    "customer_phone": "***REDACTED***",
    "customer_email": "***REDACTED***",
    ...
  }
}
```

---

### Example 2: Team Assignment Changed

**Operation:**
```sql
UPDATE bookings
SET team_id = 'new-team-uuid',
    service_location_id = 'new-location-uuid'
WHERE id = 'booking-uuid';
```

**Audit Record Created:**
```json
{
  "booking_id": "booking-uuid",
  "action": "update",
  "actor_id": "manager-uuid",
  "payload": {
    "old": {
      "id": "booking-uuid",
      "team_id": "old-team-uuid",              // ✅ Old value captured
      "service_location_id": "old-location-uuid", // ✅ Old value captured
      ...
    },
    "new": {
      "id": "booking-uuid",
      "team_id": "new-team-uuid",              // ✅ New value captured
      "service_location_id": "new-location-uuid", // ✅ New value captured
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

### Example 3: Migration from Individual to Team Assignment

**Operation:**
```sql
UPDATE bookings
SET service_location_id = 'location-uuid',
    team_id = 'team-uuid'
WHERE assigned_to = 'staff-uuid'
  AND service_location_id IS NULL;
```

**Audit Record Created:**
```json
{
  "booking_id": "booking-uuid",
  "action": "update",
  "actor_id": "migration-script-uuid",
  "payload": {
    "old": {
      "assigned_to": "staff-uuid",
      "service_location_id": null,           // ✅ Shows migration
      "team_id": null,                       // ✅ Shows migration
      ...
    },
    "new": {
      "assigned_to": "staff-uuid",           // ✅ Preserved during dual-write
      "service_location_id": "location-uuid", // ✅ New assignment
      "team_id": "team-uuid",                // ✅ New assignment
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

## Query Examples for Audit Analysis

### Find all team assignment changes:
```sql
SELECT
  ba.id,
  ba.booking_id,
  ba.action,
  ba.actor_id,
  ba.created_at,
  ba.payload->'old'->>'team_id' as old_team_id,
  ba.payload->'new'->>'team_id' as new_team_id,
  ba.payload->'old'->>'service_location_id' as old_location_id,
  ba.payload->'new'->>'service_location_id' as new_location_id
FROM booking_audits ba
WHERE ba.action = 'update'
  AND (
    ba.payload->'old'->>'team_id' IS DISTINCT FROM ba.payload->'new'->>'team_id'
    OR
    ba.payload->'old'->>'service_location_id' IS DISTINCT FROM ba.payload->'new'->>'service_location_id'
  )
ORDER BY ba.created_at DESC;
```

### Find bookings migrated from individual to team assignment:
```sql
SELECT
  ba.id,
  ba.booking_id,
  ba.created_at,
  ba.payload->'old'->>'assigned_to' as assigned_to,
  ba.payload->'old'->>'team_id' as old_team_id,
  ba.payload->'new'->>'team_id' as new_team_id,
  ba.payload->'new'->>'service_location_id' as new_location_id
FROM booking_audits ba
WHERE ba.action = 'update'
  AND ba.payload->'old'->>'team_id' IS NULL
  AND ba.payload->'new'->>'team_id' IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY ba.created_at DESC;
```

### Count team assignments by actor:
```sql
SELECT
  u.email as actor_email,
  COUNT(*) as team_assignments
FROM booking_audits ba
JOIN auth.users u ON u.id = ba.actor_id
WHERE ba.action = 'update'
  AND ba.payload->'old'->>'team_id' IS DISTINCT FROM ba.payload->'new'->>'team_id'
GROUP BY u.email
ORDER BY team_assignments DESC;
```

## Additional Audit Considerations

### 1. Audit Log Retention ✅

The current audit implementation:
- ✅ Stores all changes indefinitely
- ✅ Uses indexes for efficient querying
- ✅ Masks PII to comply with data protection regulations

**Recommendation:** Monitor audit log size and implement archival strategy if needed.

### 2. Audit Log Access ✅

The RLS policy on `booking_audits`:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Provider members can view booking audits"
  ON public.booking_audits
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM public.bookings b
      WHERE b.id = booking_audits.booking_id
        AND public.is_provider_member(b.provider_id, auth.uid(), 'viewer'::public.provider_role)
    )
  );
```

**This means:**
- ✅ All provider members can view audit logs for their provider's bookings
- ✅ Team-based access is inherited from bookings table access
- ✅ No changes needed for team-based model

### 3. Performance Considerations ✅

The audit trigger:
- ✅ Runs AFTER the operation (doesn't block the transaction)
- ✅ Uses SECURITY DEFINER for consistent permissions
- ✅ Has proper indexes on `booking_id`, `created_at`, `actor_id`

**No performance concerns identified.**

---

## Conclusion

**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED - NO CHANGES NEEDED

The existing `audit_booking_changes()` trigger automatically captures all changes to the bookings table, including:
- ✅ `service_location_id` assignments
- ✅ `team_id` assignments
- ✅ Migration from `assigned_to` to team-based model
- ✅ All other booking field changes

**No migration or code changes are required for Phase 2 audit trigger updates.**
