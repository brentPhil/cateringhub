# Phase 2: RLS Policies & Security - Summary

**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ AUDIT COMPLETE, üîÑ IMPLEMENTATION IN PROGRESS

---

## Overview

Phase 2 focuses on updating Row Level Security (RLS) policies to support the new team-based assignment model while maintaining backwards compatibility during the migration period.

---

## Completed Work

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Audit and Cleanup Existing RLS Policies

**Files Created:**
- `20251101000008_rls_policy_audit.md` - Comprehensive audit of all existing RLS policies
- `20251101000009_cleanup_rls_policies.sql` - Migration to clean up and update policies

**Key Findings:**
- **20 total policies audited** across 5 core tables
- **2 critical policies** requiring team-based updates (bookings SELECT, UPDATE)
- **7 policies** simplified to remove redundant logic
- **11 policies** kept as-is (already clean)

**Changes Made:**

1. **Bookings Policies (2 updated)**
   - ‚úÖ SELECT: Now supports team-based access via `is_team_member_for_booking()`
   - ‚úÖ UPDATE: Now supports team-based access via `is_team_member_for_booking()`
   - ‚úÖ Backwards compatibility: Still supports `assigned_to` during migration
   - ‚úÖ Role hierarchy: Managers see all, staff see team bookings, customers see own

2. **Service Locations Policies (4 simplified)**
   - ‚úÖ Removed redundant `providers.user_id` checks
   - ‚úÖ Now use `is_provider_member()` helper function consistently
   - ‚úÖ Cleaner, more maintainable code

3. **Providers Policies (3 simplified)**
   - ‚úÖ Removed redundant `user_id` checks
   - ‚úÖ Now use `is_provider_member()` helper function consistently
   - ‚úÖ Proper role hierarchy enforcement

**Backwards Compatibility:**
- ‚úÖ Staff can access bookings via EITHER team membership OR individual assignment
- ‚úÖ Dual-write support during migration period
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing functionality

---

## Remaining Tasks in Phase 2

### üîÑ Task 2: Write Team-Based RLS Policies
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE (done in cleanup migration)

The team-based policies were implemented in migration `20251101000009`:
- Bookings SELECT policy uses `is_team_member_for_booking()`
- Bookings UPDATE policy uses `is_team_member_for_booking()`
- Helper functions from migration `20251101000006` are utilized

---

### üîÑ Task 3: Retain Role Hierarchy
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE (done in cleanup migration)

Role hierarchy is properly maintained:
- **Owners/Admins/Managers**: See all bookings for their provider
- **Staff**: See bookings for their team + individually assigned (migration)
- **Customers**: See their own bookings
- Uses `is_provider_member(provider_id, user_id, min_role)` for hierarchy checks

---

### ‚è≥ Task 4: Add Policies for Teams Table
**Status:** ‚úÖ ALREADY DONE (in migration 20251101000002)

The teams table already has RLS policies:
- SELECT: All provider members can view teams
- INSERT: Managers+ can create teams
- UPDATE: Managers+ can update teams
- DELETE: Managers+ can delete teams

**No additional work needed.**

---

### ‚è≥ Task 5: Update Audit Triggers
**Status:** üî¥ TODO

**Required Actions:**
1. Review existing `audit_booking_changes` trigger
2. Add `service_location_id` and `team_id` to audit trail
3. Ensure all team-related changes are logged
4. Test audit logging for team assignments

**Files to Create:**
- `20251101000011_update_booking_audit_triggers.sql`

---

### ‚è≥ Task 6: Backwards Compatibility During Migration
**Status:** ‚úÖ PARTIALLY COMPLETE

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ Bookings policies support both `assigned_to` and team-based access
- ‚úÖ Dual-write logic documented in migration notes

**Remaining:**
- ‚è≥ Implement feature flag `ENABLE_TEAM_BASED_ASSIGNMENT`
- ‚è≥ Create migration to toggle between individual and team-based RLS
- ‚è≥ Document feature flag usage in API layer

**Files to Create:**
- `20251101000012_add_feature_flag_support.sql` (optional - may be app-level)

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Complete Task 5**: Update audit triggers for team assignments
2. ‚è≥ **Optional Task 6**: Implement feature flag support (may be app-level)
3. ‚úÖ **Mark Phase 2 Complete**: Once all tasks verified
4. üîÑ **Proceed to Phase 3**: API & Backend Modifications

---

## Notes

### Backwards Compatibility Strategy

During the migration period, the system supports BOTH assignment models:

**Individual Assignment (Legacy):**
- `bookings.assigned_to` ‚Üí UUID of assigned staff member
- Staff can access via `assigned_to = auth.uid()`

**Team-Based Assignment (New):**
- `bookings.service_location_id` ‚Üí UUID of service location
- `bookings.team_id` ‚Üí UUID of assigned team
- Staff can access via `is_team_member_for_booking(booking_id, auth.uid())`

**Migration Path:**
1. ‚úÖ Add new columns (service_location_id, team_id)
2. ‚úÖ Update RLS policies to support both models
3. ‚è≥ Backfill existing bookings with team assignments
4. ‚è≥ Enable dual-write mode (write both assigned_to and team_id)
5. ‚è≥ Gradually migrate all bookings to team-based model
6. ‚è≥ Remove assigned_to checks from RLS policies
7. ‚è≥ Archive assigned_to column (keep for historical queries)

### Performance Considerations

All new policies use indexed columns and helper functions with `SECURITY DEFINER` for optimal performance:
- `idx_bookings_team_event_date_status` - Team-based booking queries
- `idx_provider_members_team_status` - Team membership queries
- Helper functions use efficient EXISTS checks and proper indexes
